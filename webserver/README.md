# DeepLocRNA

DeeplocRNA is a deep neural network that predict the RNA localization, enabling the prediction across 5 RNA species (mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and different species (Human and Mouse). 
In this webserver, we support the input file in a ".fasta" format. Because of the limited computational resource, webserver only support limited sequence prediction.
Alternatively, if you want to predict a large number of RNA sequence, please download our standalone tool by
```
pip install DeepLocRNA
```
More instructions of the standalone tool can refer to our git repository as: https://github.com/TerminatorJ/DeepLocRNA/DeepLocRNA/README.md
